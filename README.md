## Wallets & Accounts

I have created 4 different accounts so I can properly manage the use-case and test it out:

* PL_DAZU_Treasury - this is the main dazu treasury which holds the money we've created and are managing in our wallets
* PL_USA_User - this is a user in the US who wants to send USD or receive USD
* PL_USA_LP - a user in the US who is deposited USD into the pool and getting the money from them
* PL_EG_User - this is a user in Egypt who wants to send EGP abroad or receive EGP in Egypt
* PL_EG_LP - This is a liquidity pool in the US.

We can split the users into:
* Stakers
* Transactors

## Liqudiity Pools

I need a liquidity pool which holds all the tokens
